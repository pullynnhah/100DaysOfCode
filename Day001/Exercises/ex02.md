## Debugging

# Instructions

Look at the code below. There are errors in all the lines of code. Fix the code  on [ex02.py](ex02.py) so that it runs without errors.

```python
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass. 

# Example Output

When you run your program, it should print the following:

```
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, there should be no errors and this is what should happen:
