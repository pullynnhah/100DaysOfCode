## Inputs

# Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string. 

e.g.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNRxEaJIWyKHuWI0Lk24t4KuZVyeew:1579706585702&q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow)

**Warning.** Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

# Example Input

```
Angela
```

# Example Output

```
6
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. You can put functions inside other functions.
2. Don't try to print anything other than the length.
