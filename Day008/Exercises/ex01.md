## Area Calc

# Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can. 

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5 

                         = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the **result should be rounded up** to **2** cans. 

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

# Example Input

```
test_h = 3
```

```
test_w = 9
```

# Example Output

```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
```

   

# Hint

**1. To round up a number**:

2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.
