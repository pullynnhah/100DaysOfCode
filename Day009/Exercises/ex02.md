## Dictionary in List

# Instructions

You are going to write a program that adds to a `travel_log`. You can see a travel_log which is a **List** that contains 2 **Dictionaries**. 

Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the `travel_log`. 

```
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
```

`You've visited Russia 2 times.`

`You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.`

**DO NOT** modify the `travel_log` directly. You need to create a function that modifies it. 

# Hint

1. Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.

2. The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.

3. Feel free to choose your own parameter names.
