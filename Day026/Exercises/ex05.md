## Dictionary Comprehension 2

# Instructions

You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called `weather_fahrenheit` that takes each temperature in degrees Celcius and converts it into degrees Farenheight.


To convert temp_c into temp_f: `(temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f`


**Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly. Try to use **Dictionary Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
{
    'Monday': 53.6, 
    'Tuesday': 57.2, 
    'Wednesday': 59.0, 
    'Thursday': 57.2, 
    'Friday': 69.8, 
    'Saturday': 71.6, 
    'Sunday': 75.2
}
```

# Hint

1. Use the keyword method for starting the Dictionary comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. You can get each of the items from a dictionary using the .items() method: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_items.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_items.asp)
