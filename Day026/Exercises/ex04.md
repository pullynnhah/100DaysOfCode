## Dictionary Comprehension 1

# Instructions

You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called `result` that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

**Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly. Try to use **Dictionary Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
{
    'What': 4, 
    'is': 2, 
    'the': 3, 
    'Airspeed': 8, 
    'Velocity': 8, 
    'of': 2, 
    'an': 2, 
    'Unladen': 7, 
    'Swallow?': 8
}
```

# Hint

1. Use the keyword method for starting the Dictionary comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. You can get a list of the words in a string by using the .split() method: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp)
